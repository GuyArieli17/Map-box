# Map-box
I've used map-drop to clone google map route creator.
When client enter the aplicaton, he get the flowing message:
![map-info](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19891974/109402472-e8874d00-795e-11eb-8ac5-8eb7e6b3df7e.jpg)

If client dicline and don't provide location move to the defualt position - Tel-Aviv.
Otherwise, the zoom will be on client position.
The client can set to points(addres) A,B and the system will provide a route from point A to B.
Another feture, the client could change vehicle to: Car,Cycling,walking.
